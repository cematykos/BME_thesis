The data analysis had 7 main steps:
1. Noise analysis
2. Generating synthetic data and testing an event detection algorithm on it
3. Extracting Ca2+ fluorescent signals and testing the algorithm on these signals
4. Build a spatial transient profile creator algorithm and test it on the synthetic data
5. Test the transient profile creator algorithm on real data
6. Plot the correlation histograms of source profiles and transient profiles of the synthetic data
7. Plot the correlation histograms of source profiles and transient profiles of the real data

The corresponding notebooks are:
1. BME_thesis_noise_analysis
2. BME_thesis_synthetic_data_gen. and event detect.
3. BME_thesis_real_data_sig._extraction and event_detect.
4. BME_synthetic_spatial_transient_profiles
